# Airbnb Tableau Analytics Project

##  Project Goal
To analyze Airbnb listings data and uncover insights related to pricing, revenue, and listing distribution to support data-driven decisions for hosts and property managers.

##  Tools Used
- Tableau (for data visualization and dashboard development)
- Excel / Python (for data cleaning and preprocessing)
- Airbnb Open Data (or [specify the dataset/source you used])

##  Key Insights & Results
- **Price by Zip Code:** Mapped average listing prices by zip code to reveal high and low-demand areas.
- **Average Bedroom Price:** Calculated and visualized the average price per bedroom to identify trends based on property size.
- **Annual Revenue Analysis:** Estimated and compared expected revenue per listing per year by zip code.
- **Distinct Bedroom Count:** Counted and visualized the number of unique bedroom listings available to highlight supply across locations.

##  Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard was created with filters to explore:
- Price by zip code
- Average price per bedroom
- Total expected revenue per year
- Distinct count of bedroom listings by location
